1) Mine previous bugs, revert to those commits and show that making those tests in-vivo would have revealed test failures (without changing the body of the test at all).

Bug characteristic:

We are looking at test cases that look like the following

Object initialization
                               <------------- In-vivo plugs in here, we don't do any initialization and just give the in-vivo state of that object
Object mutation

Object assertion               <------------- The hope is that with the in-vivo initialized object, some assertions here fail.

Its a crapshoot to find unit tests like these.

// 3) Take existing test suites, in-vivo them and run them through a grinder hoping to find new bugs.

5) In-vivo test case generation. (Empirical spin: increased test coverage)
